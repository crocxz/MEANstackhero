**this project is old and broken and needs love**

Setup steps:

1. Make sure you have mongodb and npm install
2. Run npm install in root directory
3. Manually install the following dependencies at these specific versions (they are now deprecated) by the command format 'npm install angular@1.5.6'

    "angular": "^1.5.6",
    "angular-route": "^1.5.6"

 4. Start mongodb by running mongod.exe and mongo.exe in that order (can add these to PATH variable to make this easier)
 5. npm start   ->   check out localhost:3000/
